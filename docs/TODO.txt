- Add CallingFunctionRecipient:
  "CallingFunctionRecipient" is an exception that is supposed to be 
  handled by the calling function. Its actually a CheckedException but more pedagogic.
  Actually is not really an Exception and must be used just for long-lasting 
  (I/O or CPU intensive) functions.
  - Try to generalize maybe to:
    - ControllerLayerRecipient:
    - BusinessLogicRecipient:
    - ServiceLogicRecipient:
    That is, different recipients inside the (micro)process.
